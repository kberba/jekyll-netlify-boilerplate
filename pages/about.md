Hello again! You know my name, but who am I exactly?

I'm currently a CS student at Oregon State University, living in Long Beach, CA. My first degree was a BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences from UC Irvine.

After 3 years in the pharmacy field, I decided to change careers and go back to school to pursue my passion for computer science. While in school, I developed an interest in all things UX-related! (Shoutout to OSU's CS 352 Usability Engineering course!). I'm currently devouring all books and resources related to UX, IxD, HCI, and Product Design. 

Outside of school, I'm working on exploring iOS development, HCI, UX design and VR/AR. (Stay tuned for future projects!)

If you know of any opportunities or projects that need another person, I'd be happy to collaborate. I have several years of experience working on teams, both in-person and remotely, and I can promise that I will give my best effort in any project that I am a part of.
