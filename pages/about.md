Hi, I'm Karen! I'm a non-traditional student studying computer science with a background in pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences.

My skills include: being able to work on and lead teams (remote and in-person), research, problem solving and customer service.

Outside of school, I'm working on exploring web development, HCI, UX design, and IoT (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).
