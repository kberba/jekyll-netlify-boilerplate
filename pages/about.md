Hello again! You know my name, but who am I exactly? ðŸ¤”

I'm currently a CS student at Oregon State University, living in Long Beach, CA. My first degree was a BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences from UC Irvine. 

After 3 years in the pharmacy field, I decided to change careers and go back to school to pursue my passion for computer science. ðŸš€ I left the world of pharmacy and have never looked back! While in school, I developed an interest in all things UX-related! (Shoutout to OSU's CS 352 Usability Engineering course!). I'm currently devouring all books and resources related to UX, IxD, HCI, and Product Design. 

When Iâ€™m not scratching my head wondering why valgrind is mad at me again, Iâ€™m exploring the world with my partner, taking photos with my Konica/Fuji Instax cameras/Polaroid camera/cell phone ðŸ“¸, or trying to learn something new! (Right now Iâ€™ve taken up learning how to play the trumpet, as well as skateboard! ðŸ˜®) I'm also working on exploring iOS development, HCI, UX design and VR/AR. (Stay tuned for future projects!)

If you know of any opportunities or projects that need another person, I'd be happy to collaborate. I have several years of experience working on teams, both in-person and remotely, and I can promise that I will give my best effort in any project that I am a part of.
