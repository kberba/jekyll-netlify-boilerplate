### AthenaHacks? What's that?

So what is a AthenaHacks? AthenaHacks is an all-female hackathon held at USC (Los Angeles, CA) aimed at narrowing the gender gap in tech. 

Here's their site description: 

"Join us for a weekend dedicated to filling the gender gap, exploring technology, and building the next big thing! Our mission is to support and nurture women* in tech by hosting Southern California's premiere all female* hackathon. Expect a weekend full of workshops, mentorship, tech talks, social activities, food, and more! No experience necessary, you just need passion.

*trans and non-binary inclusive"

### First Ever Hackathon

This was my first hackathon ever, so I didn't really know what to expect!
