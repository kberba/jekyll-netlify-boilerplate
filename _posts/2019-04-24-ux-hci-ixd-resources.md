Hi everyone! I just wanted to share some resources I've been using throughout my process of learning more about UX Design, HCI, and IxD (user experience design, human computer interaction, and interaction design, respectively). I'm hoping I can find more resources about accessibility, as well as ways we can better and more actively incorporate accessibility into our designs. My plan is to write about each of these resources at length in their own posts (or at least here!). Please feel free to let me know what resources you found useful (usable, and used --- see what I did there?) in your learning and growth. 🌱
