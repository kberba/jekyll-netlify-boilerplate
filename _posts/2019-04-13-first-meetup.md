I've joined a lot of meetup groups, but I hadn't actually attended any of them until now! 

And wow, what an experience! 

At first, I was super nervous because I didn't know anyone prior. I kept thinking, 'all of them must know each other and I'm just going to stand out awkwardly...' 

Thankfully, that wasn't the case! After introductions and a general overview of what CCLB was all about, we all set about to mingle and find out more about what we're interested in and/or working on. The first friendly face I met was also a first-timer at CCLB -- Pat! He's a web developer freelancer and was incredibly friendly and eager to learn all the things! I also met a UI Designer named Taka who graciously let me ask him tons of questions about his experience as a designer, as well as what resources he used to learn and create his projects. I met another person named Jorde that showed me the awesomeness of ThreeJS!
