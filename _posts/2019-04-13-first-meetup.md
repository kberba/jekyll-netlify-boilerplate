I've joined a lot of meetup groups, but I hadn't actually attended any of them until now! 

And wow, what an experience! ðŸ™‚

At first, I was super nervous because I didn't know anyone prior. I kept thinking, 'all of them must know each other and I'm just going to stand out awkwardly...' ðŸ˜Ÿ

Thankfully, that wasn't the case! After introductions and a general overview of what CCLB was all about, we all set about to mingle and find out more about what we're interested in and/or working on.

Look how cute we all are!

#### Shout-outs! ðŸ˜Ž

The first friendly face I met was also a first-timer at CCLB -- Pat! He's a web developer freelancer and was incredibly friendly, encouraging, and eager to learn all the things! 

I met a UI Designer named Taka who graciously let me ask him tons of questions about his experience as a designer, as well as what resources he used to learn and create his projects. Thank so much for the pdfs!

I also met another person named Jorde that showed me the awesomeness of ThreeJS! It's seriously mind-blowing how amazing ThreeJs is, and what people have come up with through using it! Check it out [here](https://threejs.org/)! Trust me, once you start clicking through all of the projects, you won't stop! Also, if you click on the 'examples' link on the left, you can see preview what each feature does!

### Will I go back again?

I will definitely try! I'm really glad I went out of my comfort zone and finally attended a meetup, especially Code and Coffee Long Beach. I can't even begin to describe what a great experience it was talking with people of varying skill levels, but with so much passion for programming and learning! If you're wavering about attending a meetup, I encourage you to go try! I promise you'll definitely leave having learned something new (and probably even make a few new friends!). ðŸ˜Š
